## Usage

### Setup

First-time Clojure developers, assuming you have [jdk7 or above](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html), must first install leiningen (a build and task runner similar to mvn, pip, or npm):

    brew install leiningen

Run the server, auto reload classes, compile less files and cljs->js, all _in one go_.

    lein ringo
